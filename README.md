# VHUD
This was my senior project where my team and I created a dashboard proof of concept for a vehichle on a mobile device. The application used an on-board diagnostic tool for a vehicle to transmit data to a tablet. We displayed the data on the screen and used technology similar to how a teleprompter works to display all relevant data on the windshield of a vehicle.
